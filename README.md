Iterate is an android application that applies algorithms to images in order to create generative art. A user is able to choose from their library or take an image and apply the algorithm. A user can sign-in using Google sign in and they are able to access any photographs they have saved on their account. At the moment Fibonacci is the only algorithm that can be applied and the option to save a photograph or view its history of iteration is not available.  The bottom navigation allows you to switch from home and gallery. The next version will allow for more algorithms to be applied and the gallery will lead to the images that have gone through one or many iterations within the app. Additionally, there will be a progress bar that would indicate to the user that the image has began processing. There will be an implementation of a splash screen and customized fonts to fit the aesthetic of the application.  Finally, the app will allow you to save photos to your library after undergoing iterations.
