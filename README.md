Iterate is an app that uses algorithms to create generative art that the user can save as either images or gifs/videos. It  allows the user to choose from different shapes, textures, or images and apply the algorithm they choose to create the visualization. A user is able to use their camera and apply the algorithm to live visuals as well. The user who would find my app appealing finds the visualization of data interesting, they see math as not something difficult but a beautiful language. Users may also have trouble easing anxiety and find the repetitive nature of the visualizations relaxing. Users pay attention to detail and find aesthetically pleasing design beneficial to their quality of life. The data that will persist in the Android system will be any history of drawing saved to the app, the menu allowing to choose from different settings, and a default visualization. This app can gather data from online images and shapes to import into the app (ex. Instagram, google image, vimeo,etc).  It will also pull from online databases that provide complimentary colors and such to create aesthetically pleasing designs. The navigation that seemed the most fitting was master-detail as it stated it could potentially allow for addition, deletion, and editing. I do wish to have video as an option to be distorted but first I would like to tackle still images and shapes.
