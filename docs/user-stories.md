* As a user I have been developing generative art for 10 years and I want to explore your iteration of algorithms so that I may compare them to the work I am doing.
* As a user I am new to trying to distort images and I would like to experiment so that I can share them with my friends.
* As a user I am interested in the visualization of algorithms so I can better understand the concepts I am learning in Maths.
* As a user I find repetitive patterns calming and a great way to give myself a break from the chaos of my day to day life.
